# Proxy Changer
This is a Program that allows you to change your Windows Proxy Server automatically from a list with a total of over 226 servers. Because they are free, public proxies, I included a ping method and a way to get the servers GeoIP Location.

This is a old project I created in July 2020. The Code might be a mess and unoptimized. I will update it so it works better and that the code looks better. 
This project uses the [metro framework](https://github.com/dennismagno/metroframework-modern-ui) (MIT License).
